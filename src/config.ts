  aboutMe:
    "I’m a design systems and UX strategy lead with roots in web, publishing, and teaching. I started by launching a record label in high school and creating everything it needed, from album art to an MP3 player in ActionScript. Since then, I’ve taught design, built content platforms, scaled design operations in a 50+ person org, and led UX for public-facing sites and MVPs. My work blends creative direction with product-minded systems.",
